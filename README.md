## About Me

Hello! I'm Umer Ghafoor, a passionate programmer with a keen interest in building desktop and Android applications. I also have a strong inclination towards programming electronics. I specialize in C++, Dart, Python, Julia, HTML, and CSS. Though I haven't been programming for a long time, I have been actively involved in programming for the past year, constantly learning and improving my skills.
